## What I Would Do With More Time

[List features, improvements, or refactorings you would add if you had more time]

Examples:

- Add loading states with skeleton loaders
- Implement more robust error handling
- Add unit tests for components
- Improve accessibility (ARIA labels, keyboard navigation)
- Add animations for better UX
- Implement URL state management
- Add more filter categories
- etc.

## Libraries/Packages Added

- `@tabler/icons-react` – installed for adding icon support in the React app

[If you added any packages beyond the starter, list them here with explanations]

## AI Tools Used

I used a few AI tools while building this:

- **Claude Code**: Helped me figure out FastAPI since I'm more familiar with Node.js backends. Used it mainly for the `/api/candidates` endpoint structure and getting the query params right. Also helped with the search and pagination logic and used it a couple times when I hit TypeScript errors or needed a quick answer on React patterns.
- **GitHub Copilot**: Had it running in the background for autocomplete. Mostly used it for React/TypeScript boilerplate and when I was stuck on UI stuff.

Overall, these tools saved me time, especially with FastAPI since it was new to me. They helped me move faster on syntax and patterns I wasn't super familiar with.

Examples:

- Used GitHub Copilot for autocompletion
- Used ChatGPT to debug a TypeScript error
- Used Claude to understand FastAPI query parameters
- etc.
